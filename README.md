## CONCLUSION 
In conclusion, the TED Talk Views Prediction project has successfully developed a regression model using a comprehensive set of variables such as talk_id, title, speaker information, occupations, views, recorded and published dates, event details, language information, comments, duration, topics, related talks, URL, description, and transcript. The model has been trained and tested on a large dataset of TED talks to accurately predict the number of views for videos uploaded on the TEDx website.

The results of the model have shown promising performance, with a high degree of accuracy in estimating the views of TED talks. By leveraging the available data, the model can provide valuable insights into the factors that contribute to the popularity and viewership of TED talks. This information can be beneficial for content creators, event organizers, and the TED community as a whole.

The predictive model not only helps in understanding the key drivers of video views but also enables TED to optimize its content strategy, identify influential speakers, and enhance the impact of their talks. By harnessing the power of data and predictive modeling, TED can further engage and inspire a wider audience with its thought-provoking ideas.

Overall, the TED Talk Views Prediction project has successfully achieved its objective of building a predictive model to estimate the views of TED talks. The insights gained from this model can contribute to the continued success and impact of TED in spreading powerful ideas and fostering intellectual discourse.

## SUMMARY 

The TED Talk Views Prediction project developed a model using various information like talk details, speaker information, and video characteristics to accurately predict the number of views for TED talks. The model helps TEDx organizers plan events and marketing strategies, enables speakers to refine their presentations, and enhances viewers' experience by providing relevant recommendations. The project involved machine learning techniques, preprocessing and feature engineering of the dataset, and the use of regression algorithms. The deployed model allows users to input video information and obtain estimated view counts, aiding in decision-making and content optimization. The overall goal is to enhance the TEDx experience while spreading powerful ideas to a wider audience.
